As a Mom myself, I wanted a resource that could make my life easier in finding places to go or activities to do with my son, and also an easy place to connect with parents in the area where I live.

So I thought an  app, where a mom can go  do those things. This app would help moms find the nearest kid friendly places, activities, restaurants, or different events that might be happening or offering near their city.
This app would also allow moms to share ideas and experiences about their daily lives. It would also allow moms to communicate back and forth through our playgroup chat room and organize meetups to take advantage of the city’s amenities.
